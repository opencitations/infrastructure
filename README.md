# OpenCitations Kubernetes Infrastructure

This repository contains the Kubernetes manifests and deployment tools for deploying and managing OpenCitations services on a Kubernetes cluster. To begin working with this infrastructure, you'll need to either clone or fork this repository to your own GitHub account.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Running Kubernetes cluster with kubectl configured
- Helm package manager
- Git (for Fleet integration)
- Storage system (NFS or alternative)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Database Preparation

Before beginning the deployment, you must prepare the OpenCitations databases:

1. Download the Meta and Index databases from https://opencitations.net/download
2. Place these databases in your storage system that will be used by the infrastructure
3. Make note of the storage paths as they will be needed in the configuration

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create and configure your environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your specific configurations for services, infrastructure, and Git integration.

### 3. Storage Configuration

#### For NFS Storage:
1. Edit `preliminary/00-secrets.yaml` with your NFS configuration
2. Modify `preliminary/02-storage.yaml` with your NFS paths and settings
3. Ensure the following variables are properly set in `.env`:
   - `NFS_SERVER`
   - `NFS_CERT_PATH`
   - `NFS_DATA_PATH`

#### For Alternative Storage:
1. Modify both `preliminary/00-secrets.yaml` and `preliminary/02-storage.yaml` to match your storage system's requirements
2. Update the corresponding storage variables in `.env`

### 4. Traefik Configuration

1. Edit `preliminary/03-traefik-values.yaml`:
   - Modify `additionalArguments` section for HTTPS certificate configuration
   - If not using MetalLB, remove the MetalLB-specific configurations

### 5. Domain Configuration

Update the domain addresses in service manifests:
- Web service manifests
- API service manifests
- Any other services with web addresses

These files are located in the `manifests/` directory.

### 5b. WordPress Backup Configuration

The infrastructure includes an automated backup system for WordPress using rclone and pCloud storage. The system performs daily backups of:
- WordPress database (SQL dump)
- WordPress files
- MariaDB raw data

Configure the backup system by setting the appropriate variables in your `.env`:
```ini
WORDPRESS_SUBPATH=wordpress_prod
MARIADB_SUBPATH=mariadb_prod
BACKUP_SCHEDULE="0 2 * * *"
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=90
PCLOUD_BACKUP_FOLDER=backup/wordpress
RCLONE_CONFIG=your_base64_encoded_config
```

### 6. Fleet Integration

Fleet provides automated deployment capabilities through Git repository monitoring.

#### Fleet Repository Setup

1. Create a private Git repository for your production manifests
2. Configure Fleet variables in `.env`:
```bash
PRIVATE_REPO_URL=https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
GIT_USERNAME=your-username
GIT_TOKEN=your-personal-access-token
```

#### Fleet Configuration in Rancher

If using Rancher:

1. Navigate to Rancher UI â†’ Continuous Delivery
2. Create a new Git Repository with:
   - Name: opencitations-fleet
   - Repository URL: Your private repository URL
   - Branch: main
   - Paths: ./ (root directory)
   - Target cluster: Your cluster name

If using standalone Fleet:

1. Create a Fleet configuration file `fleet.yaml`:
```yaml
namespace: opencitations
targetCustomizations:
  - name: production
    clusterSelector:
      matchLabels:
        environment: production
```

2. Apply the configuration:
```bash
kubectl apply -f fleet.yaml
```

### 7. Deployment

Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The deployment script (`deploy.py`) provides several options:

```bash
./deploy.py -i    # Initialize infrastructure
./deploy.py -p    # Preview manifest or preliminary files with variable substitution
./deploy.py -f    # Create Fleet-ready production files
./deploy.py       # Deploy all services
./deploy.py <manifest>  # Deploy a specific manifest file
```

#### Initialize Infrastructure
```bash
./deploy.py -i
```

This will guide you through:
1. Creating Kubernetes secrets
2. Setting up MetalLB (if used)
3. Configuring storage
4. Installing Traefik
5. Setting up the Traefik dashboard

#### Preview Configuration
```bash
./deploy.py -p <file>  # Preview how variables will be substituted
```
This allows you to verify your configuration before deployment by showing how environment variables will be substituted in your YAML files.

#### Deploy Using Fleet
```bash
./deploy.py -f  # For Fleet-managed deployments
```
This will process all manifests and push them to your Fleet repository.

#### Direct Deployment
```bash
./deploy.py                            # Deploy all manifest
./deploy.py manifest/0x-manifest.yaml  # Deploy a specific service
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. Check the logs of the deployment script
2. Verify your environment variables in `.env`
3. Ensure all prerequisites are properly installed
4. Check your Kubernetes cluster's status and connectivity
5. Verify storage system accessibility

For more detailed troubleshooting, consult the Kubernetes and Fleet documentation.
